* To order to run the file proj2.c one must navigate into its directory. I created many different text files that has
  data to be tested and will include a couple of them within the main file. I also included a couple of screen shots of 
  the final output of all three sceduling algorithms


* To compile proj2.c navigate to the directory. Then type: gcc -std=c99 proj2.c -o proj2


* Running the files(filename = input.1.txt / input.2.txt / input.4.txt )   ./proj2 (filename) (Algorithm) (Quantum)

	-Examples: ./proj2 input.1.txt RR 2  / ./proj2 input.1.txt FCFS  / proj2 input.1.txt SRTF
		   ./proj2 input.2.txt RR 2  / ./proj2 input.2.txt FCFS  / proj2 input.2.txt SRTF
